We use reinforcement learning to learn tree-structured neural networks for computing representations of natural language sentences
In contrast with prior work on tree-structured models, in which the trees are either provided as input or predicted using supervision from explicit treebank annotations, the tree structures
in this work are optimized to improve performance on a downstream task
Languages encode meaning in terms of hierarchical
To place this work in context, there are three predominant approaches for constructing vector representations of sentences from a sequence of words
Our work can be understood as a compromise between the first two approaches
Our model consists of two components
Our sentence representation model follows
Among the many users of machine learning systems are a new wave of computer scientists calling themselves "data miners"
The Center will pioneer an emerging field that brings together statistics and the recent extensive advances in theoretically well-founded machine learning.
The intelligent systems built on machine learning algorithms have the capability to learn from past experience or historical data
Speech recognition is used in the applications like voice user interface, voice searches and more
